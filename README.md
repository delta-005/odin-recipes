Project to test my basic HTML 

This is a small project to test my basic HTML I've learned till now

The main index.html contain links that redirects to specific recipe page and on the page there's the heading, a finshid photo, a small description, ingredients, and steps to follow

so far I only have pancakes and a smoothie recipe
